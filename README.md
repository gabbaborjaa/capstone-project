# Project Build

* Run "git clone" in the command line to clone the repo.

* Install the node packages by running "npm install" or "npm i"

* Run the Webpack Build Config first by executing "npm run build-dev" in the command line. This also builds the "dist-dev" folder for the project.

* Run the Webpack Production Config by executing "npm run build-prod" to build the production and other dist folder

* After this you may run "npm start" to run the server on Express and "npm test" to test out Jest

You may run other scripts if you wish, but that won't really do anything.
